       <h1>What is soil acidity?</h1> 
Soil acidity is a condition in which the soil pH is lower than a neutral pH (less than 7). Soil pH is a measure of the hydrogen (H+) ion concentration expressed as the negative common logarithm of H+ concentration. It is an index of the activity of H+ as it interacts with soil components, nutrients in the soil solution (water) and plants growing in the soil.
of soil acidity
Initial soil characteristics such as soil parent material, climate and original native vegetation determined soil pH prior to their cultivation. Some North soils were formed on acidic parent materials and are naturally slightly acidic. Repeated use of ammonium-based acid-forming fertilizers, leaching of nitrate-N (NO3-N) and plants taking up cations and leaving anions all promote acidification of the topsoil when cultivated.
<h1> Types of Soil Acidity </h1> 
Two types of acidity occur in soils. Soil acidity determined by pH measurement during a routine soil test is known as active acidity. This is the concentration of H+ ions in the soil solution when measured in a 1:1 soil-to-water ratio mixture.
However, not all H+ ions are released immediately by the soil into solution. A portion of the H+ ions remain attached to negatively charged exchange sites on clay and organic matter (OM) particles.
This acidity is called reserve acidity because H+ can be released into solution as soil solution conditions change due to moisture changes, and concentrations of dissolved ions and salts occur. This acidity can be measured by the addition of a dilute calcium chloride solution (0.01 M CaCl2) or a buffer to the water pH suspension.
Active and reserve acidity (measured as water and buffer pH) are related but their relationship varies due to types and quantities of clay minerals, organic matter and free lime in the soil. Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), which is related to the type and quantity of clay and organic matter, influences the ratio of reserve acidity to active acidity. Soils with a higher CEC (higher clay and OM) resist (buffer) acidification better than soils with a low CEC (sandy, lower  clay and OM).
Effect of Soil Acidity on Plant Nutrient Availability 
Excessively acidic soils may lead to a dramatic decline in crop and pasture production because the pH of the soil changes the availability of soil nutrients.
Acidic soils may have some or all of the following problems:
<ol>
<li>helpful soil micro-organisms may be prevented from recycling nutrients (e.g. nitrogen supply may be reduced)	</li>phosphorus in the soil may become less available to plants
<li>deficiencies of calcium, magnesium and molybdenum may occur
    </li>the ability of plants to use subsoil moisture may be limited
	<li>aluminium, which is toxic to plants and micro-organisms, may be released from the soil
    </li>levels of manganese may reach toxic levels  
 <li> up take by crops and pastures of the heavy metal contaminant, cadmium, may increase.
</li>   up take by crops and pastures of the heavy metal contaminant, cadmium, may increase.
</ol>
<h1>Signs of soil acidity</h1>
<ol><li>Acidic soil has a pH below 7. The common pH range for acidic soil is between 4 and 6. Acidic soil is often found in areas with high rainfall
    </li><li>Acidic soils tend to have low nutrient availability for several important nutrients, such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P).
        </li><li>Poor growth and development of plant
            </li><li>Poor yielding due to nutrient deficiency
            </li></ol>

<h1>Control measures</h1>
It is most important that soil acidity be treated using liming material at an early stage. If acidity spreads into the subsoil, serious yield reduction may occur. Subsoil acidity is difficult and costly to control.
There are a number of ways to minimize the soil acidification process, including:
•	the use of less acidifying farming practices—considered when soils show signs of acidifications
•	applications of agricultural lime—applied to counter the acidification caused by cropping systems
