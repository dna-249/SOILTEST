     <h1>What is soil acidity?</h1> 
Soil acidity is a condition in which the soil pH is lower than a neutral pH (less than 7). Soil pH is a measure of the hydrogen (H+) ion concentration expressed as the negative common logarithm of H+ concentration. It is an index of the activity of H+ as it interacts with soil components, nutrients in the soil solution (water) and plants growing in the soil.
of soil acidity
Initial soil characteristics such as soil parent material, climate and original native vegetation determined soil pH prior to their cultivation. Some North soils were formed on acidic parent materials and are naturally slightly acidic. Repeated use of ammonium-based acid-forming fertilizers, leaching of nitrate-N (NO3-N) and plants taking up cations and leaving anions all promote acidification of the topsoil when cultivated.
