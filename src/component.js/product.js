  <h3> Types of Soil Acidity </h3> 
Two types of acidity occur in soils. Soil acidity determined by pH measurement during a routine soil test is known as active acidity. This is the concentration of H+ ions in the soil solution when measured in a 1:1 soil-to-water ratio mixture.
However, not all H+ ions are released immediately by the soil into solution. A portion of the H+ ions remain attached to negatively charged exchange sites on clay and organic matter (OM) particles.
This acidity is called reserve acidity because H+ can be released into solution as soil solution conditions change due to moisture changes, and concentrations of dissolved ions and salts occur. This acidity can be measured by the addition of a dilute calcium chloride solution (0.01 M CaCl2) or a buffer to the water pH suspension.
Active and reserve acidity (measured as water and buffer pH) are related but their relationship varies due to types and quantities of clay minerals, organic matter and free lime in the soil. Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), which is related to the type and quantity of clay and organic matter, influences the ratio of reserve acidity to active acidity. Soils with a higher CEC (higher clay and OM) resist (buffer) acidification better than soils with a low CEC (sandy, lower  clay and OM).
Effect of Soil Acidity on Plant Nutrient Availability 
Excessively acidic soils may lead to a dramatic decline in crop and pasture production because the pH of the soil changes the availability of soil nutrients.
Acidic soils may have some or all of the following problems:
<ol>
<li>helpful soil micro-organisms may be prevented from recycling nutrients (e.g. nitrogen supply may be reduced)	</li>phosphorus in the soil may become less available to plants
<li>deficiencies of calcium, magnesium and molybdenum may occur
    </li>the ability of plants to use subsoil moisture may be limited
	<li>aluminium, which is toxic to plants and micro-organisms, may be released from the soil
    </li>levels of manganese may reach toxic levels  
 <li> up take by crops and pastures of the heavy metal contaminant, cadmium, may increase.
</li>   up take by crops and pastures of the heavy metal contaminant, cadmium, may increase.
