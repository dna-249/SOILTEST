        <h1>Control measures</h1>
It is most important that soil acidity be treated using liming material at an early stage. If acidity spreads into the subsoil, serious yield reduction may occur. Subsoil acidity is difficult and costly to control.
There are a number of ways to minimize the soil acidification process, including:
•	the use of less acidifying farming practices—considered when soils show signs of acidifications
•	applications of agricultural lime—applied to counter the acidification caused by cropping systems
